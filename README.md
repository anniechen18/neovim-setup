# neovim-setup
Hello! This guide is mainly for *new* vim users. If you are already familiar with vim, you can skip past most of these steps and just grab what you need from `init.vim`.

For all the other new vim users, I first want to give a disclaimer that while vim/neovim is powerful to use and loved by many, it may be overwhelming and initimidating to begin with. But let us not fear! We are on our way to having a new tool in our toolbox and that is very exciting.

This guide goes through how to set up neovim, with latter sections tailoring towards Haskell programming because I will mainly be programming in Haskell.

## Set up
1. [Install neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Installing-Neovim)

   Homebrew on macOS or linux: `brew install neovim`
2. Install a plugin manager

    There are a couple of different vim plugin managers out there, but I chose to use [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug#neovim)
